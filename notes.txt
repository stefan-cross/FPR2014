Heres an insight:

*Main> let x = Fan 2 `Beside` Fan 2
*Main> :i x
x :: Circuit 	-- Defined at <interactive>:348:5
*Main> :t x
x :: Circuit
*Main> x `Above` x
Above (Beside (Fan 2) (Fan 2)) (Beside (Fan 2) (Fan 2))




On another note:
Starting to think that we should have to pass in circuit representaion as a list in order to step through arguements passed in...
Then we could utilise standard list functions to loop through circuit representations
eg instead of;

(Fan 2 ‘Beside‘ Fan 2) ‘Above‘ 
Stretch [ 2, 2 ] (Fan 2) ‘Above‘ 
(Id 1 ‘Beside‘ Fan 2 ‘Beside‘ Id 1)

[[Fan 2], [Beside], [Fan 2]] `Above` 
[Stretch [ 2, 2 ]], [Fan 2]] `Above` 
[[Id 1], [`Beside`], [Fan 2] `Beside` [Id 1]]

The issue then is with the treat ment of Between and Above types as there definitions loose meaning;

*Main> let q = [(Id 1) `Beside` (Fan 2)]
*Main> :t q
q :: [Circuit]
*Main> head q
Beside (Id 1) (Fan 2)
*Main> let r = head q
*Main> :t q
q :: [Circuit]
*Main> q
[Beside (Id 1) (Fan 2)]

And difficult to get the representations back to intended meaning, I think we need to take a tree approach on how trees were nested and how we counted nodes/size of a tree...
